# PopulationVsHappiness

For this project I took a look at the population data and the World Happiness rankings from the last several years and see what kind of trends and correlations can be found in the data and if there is any correlation between population and a happiness score based on the Gallup World Poll. I am getting my dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report?select=2017.csv.

I also used data from web scraping and an API for population data.
